# Squid-Games-Project
This java program is meant to emulate the marble game from the Squid Games show.

The program is still incomplete, as I wanted to add in scenarios for the version of the game that the Old Man played,
as well as how Sang Woo cheated to win. Input mismatch error handling is missing as well.
However it includes the basic logic of the game, including the wagers and guessing, and works as it should.

The version of the game is chosen by a randomly generated number at the start, so if you get the Sang Woo or Old Man version, just
run the program again and you will get the normal version in 1 or 2 tries.

Hope you like it.
